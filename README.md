# Brief Overview of the Application
Due to overconsumption and impulse buying, many have products they don’t want or need anymore. At the same time, many struggle to afford products they need. Many sellers try to profit the most they can off of the things they don’t really need, and end up selling them to people who don’t need them (and would just end up as clutter), or even not selling them. This leads to excessive waste, which is environmentally harmful. 

We seek to implement a community-driven app that requires that every product sold is either free or a couple dollars (maybe < $10). Security and trustworthiness of the app can be moderated through profile verification, reviews, and a town-based map system. This app will address the global issues of unsustainable over-consumption and income inequality.

This app targets individuals with low-income, eco-conscious consumers, and people who need to declutter their homes.
